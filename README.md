Leaf Image Classification of Plant Diseases using Deep learning
Agricultural production is mainly affected by natural and anthropogenic factors. Insects and pests are one of the most threatening factors that can affect the crop yield. Identification of these threatening factors at early stages of crop production helps in reduction of agricultural losses. 
Deep learning techniques are one of the most effective methods for identification of plant diseases through plant leaf image classification. The proposed model presents a novel approach for plant disease detection with the help of Deep Learning techniques. 
A CNN model is built from scratch which has been trained effectively to segregate the input images into diseased leaf images and healthy leaf images. The constructed model is a layered CNN approach with convolution, max pooling and activation function layers stacked on each other.  It further identifies the plant name and disease name.
